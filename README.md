What are CBD Gummies?

The Basics of CBD

CBD, or Cannabidiol, is a compound derived from the hemp plant. Unlike THC, it doesn’t cause a “high” but offers numerous therapeutic benefits, including stress relief, pain management, and improved sleep.

Why Gummies? A Tasty Solution

CBD comes in many forms—oils, capsules, tinctures—but gummies are by far the most popular. They’re discreet, easy to consume, and come in tasty flavors, making them a favorite among beginners and experienced users alike.

How Do Harmony Flow CBD Gummies Work?

The Science Behind CBD

CBD interacts with the body’s Endocannabinoid System (ECS), a complex network responsible for regulating mood, sleep, pain, and immune responses.

The Endocannabinoid System (ECS)

The ECS works by interacting with cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) spread throughout the body. Harmony Flow CBD Gummies help balance these receptors, promoting overall wellness.
